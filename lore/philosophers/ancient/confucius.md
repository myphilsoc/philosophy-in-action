### Who is Confucius?

Confucius, born in 551 BCE in the state of Zhou (modern-day Shandong Province, China), was a pivotal figure in Chinese philosophy and cultural history. His birth occurred during a time of declining influence of the central Zhou dynasty, marking a period of increasing political fragmentation.

Confucius was born into a family with some noble lineage but limited wealth, especially after the early death of his father. Despite these challenges, he became well-versed in the classical rituals and ceremonies of the Zhou dynasty during his youth. This expertise set the foundation for his later career and philosophical teachings.

Throughout his life, Confucius held various governmental positions in the state of Lu, as recorded in historical texts like the Zuo Commentary (左傳). His roles varied from managing granaries to advising rulers, but his strict moral standards often led him to leave positions where he felt his principles were compromised.

In his later years, Confucius devoted himself to teaching. He is credited with educating about 3,000 students, including 77 direct disciples, imparting knowledge on classical texts and moral philosophy. His teachings emphasized ritual, personal ethics, and social and political harmony. These teachings were later compiled into several texts, the most famous being the Analects.
