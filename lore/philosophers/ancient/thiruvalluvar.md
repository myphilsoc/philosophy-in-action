### Key ideas of Thiruvalluvar

Though many details of his actual life remain shrouded in mystery and legends, his primary work, the Thirukkural, is considered one of the greatest works on ethics and morality in Tamil philosophy and literature.

Here are some of his philosophical contributions through his seminal work that remain relevant in everyday life:

<summary><strong>Water as basis of life</strong></summary>

Thiruvalluvar accords great importance water. In fact, he devoted an entire chapter titled "The Excellence of Rain" to emphasize the critical role of rain in sustaining life on earth.&#x20;

In this chapter, he outlines scenarios that would occur without rain, including hunger, farmers not plowing fields, lack of greenery, drying up of oceans, and even cessation of worship festivals.

He also uses analogies and metaphors to stress the value of water. For example, he describes rainwater as "nectar" and equates it to the very basis of a virtuous, ethical life. He explains that the path of virtuous conduct does not exist without the presence of rain to sustain the world.

He has also compared the generosity of a king to rain.  Just as the world cannot survive without rain, people cannot thrive under a king lacking in kindness.

<summary>Balancing material pursuits with ethics</summary>

While encouraging people to strive for economic prosperity, Thiruvalluvar advocates [balancing wealth (porul) with virtue (aram) and love (inbam)](https://tamilnation.org/literature/kural/nagarajan.pdf).&#x20;

Through various aphorisms, he advises against unethical means and emphasizes justice and fair trade in business dealings.

<summary>Fulfilling duties towards family and society</summary>

A householder attains merit by properly serving their parents, spouse, children, guests and other social duties. Supporting ascetics and the needy is also important.&#x20;

Thiruvalluvar considers a householder living a dharmic life as equivalent to a God on earth. In fact, out of the 1,330 couplets in the Thirukkural, [200 couplets](https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/28678#4\_Contents) focus on domestic virtue, providing guidance on household ethics and family life.

<summary>Leading integrated, harmonious and fulfilling lives</summary>

Rather than renouncing worldly life, Thiruvalluvar shows the path to moksha (liberation) through leading a holistic, fulfilling life as a householder by properly balancing aram (virtue) , porul (material pursuits) and inbam (love).

Tiruvalluvar does not see family life as an impediment to moksha but rather as a vital stage for cultivating the necessary virtues and detachment that enable spiritual liberation.&#x20;

However, to achieve this, one must work towards cultivating inner detachment, equanimity and non-possessiveness while being engaged in family life. This prepares the mind for eventual renunciation that would lead to moksha.
