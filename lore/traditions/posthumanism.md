# Posthumanism

Posthumanism is a broad intellectual movement that critically questions traditional notions of the human and humanity's place in the world. It is a response to the perceived limitations of humanism and aims to reconceptualize the human in light of technological advancements, scientific insights, and ethical imperatives.

### What are the branches within posthumanism?

There are several overlapping fields and perspectives within posthumanism.

<details>

<summary>Philosophical posthumanism</summary>

This branch critically examines and [challenges the assumptions of humanism](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02691728.2021.1893859), including the idea of a unified, autonomous human subject. It questions anthropocentrism and traditional dualisms like human/animal, nature/culture, and mind/body.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Cultural posthumanism</summary>

Exploring posthuman themes in various cultural forms such as literature, art, and cinema, this perspective often imagines alternative modes of embodiment and consciousness beyond the human.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Antihumanism</summary>

This branch rejects traditional humanist ideals as historically contingent and argues they have been used to justify exclusion and domination over non-human forms of existence.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Transhumanism</summary>

While distinct from posthumanism, transhumanism advocates the enhancement of human capacities and transcending biological limitations usually through the use of technology.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Post-anthropocentrism</summary>

This branch [critiques the hierarchical mindset](https://www.hanken.fi/en/news/posthumanism-questions-world-order-where-humans-are-top) that privileges the human above other forms of life and matter. It extends moral considerability and agency beyond [the human](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2304/eerj.2013.12.1.1).

</details>

Although posthumanism encompasses diverse perspectives, there are common threads; namely critiquing humanism and anthropocentrism, focusing on the intersection of the human condition,  technology and the environment, as well as an openness to alternative forms of embodiment and subjectivity beyond the human.

### How can we apply posthumanist ideas in everyday life?

Here are several ways that ideas from posthumanism can be applied to daily life:

<details>

<summary>Extending moral concern to non-human beings</summary>

Posthumanism encourages us to think outside of traditional human categories and extend moral consideration to non-human animals, the environment, and even artificial intelligences. In everyday life, this could mean making more ethical consumer choices, supporting animal rights, and being a good environmental steward.

<details>

<summary>Questioning human exceptionalism</summary>

Posthumanism rejects the idea that humans are separate from and superior to the rest of nature. Day-to-day, we can [recognize our interdependence](https://www.context.org/iclib/ic34/macy/) with the environment and other species, and avoid human-centric thinking.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Breaking down dualist thinking</summary>

Posthumanism seeks to [dismantle traditional binaries](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-archaeological-journal/article/reflections-on-posthuman-ethics-grievability-and-the-morethanhuman-worlds-of-iron-and-viking-age-scandinavia/1B266324E6F36C562787BB2BA4D68F89#sec4) like human/animal, nature/culture, mind/body. In lived experience, we can appreciate the blurry boundaries and interconnections between these categories.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Recognising technological influences</summary>

Posthumanism explores how humans are shaped by our technologies. In using smartphones, social media, etc., we can be mindful of [how these tools are changing us](https://ledger.humanetech.com).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Imagining possible futures</summary>

Posthumanism, especially in its critical forms, uses speculative imagination to envision more [just, sustainable posthuman futures](https://www.looper.com/1446464/what-is-solarpunk-dear-alice-ad-explained/?zsource=msnsyndicated). Through literature, art, and everyday creativity, we can participate in this transformative envisioning.
