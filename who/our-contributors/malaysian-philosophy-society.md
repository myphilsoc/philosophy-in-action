# Malaysian Philosophy Society

We are a grassroots philosophy society based in Malaysia. Our members are people from all walks of life united by a single mission to make philosophy practical and accessible to all.&#x20;

Before the inception of this guide, we were working on developing our vision by solidifying our framework on philosophical practice. It was at that time we realised that such resources weren't easily accessible through a Google search.&#x20;

Everything was all spread out across different sources, some free and paid. It was then that we realised that this vision we were trying to achieve is beyond our means. Which is why decided to transform our initial work into an open-source wiki.&#x20;
