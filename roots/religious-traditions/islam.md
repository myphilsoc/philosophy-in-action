Islam is a rich intellectual tradition that has influenced the lives of countless people around the world. While there are numerous aspects and branches within Islamic philosophy, we will focus on several central concepts and how they relate to everyday life: **Tawhid (unity of God), Ihsan (excellence), and Adab (manners and etiquette)**. We will also briefly touch on the importance of justice, compassion, and seeking knowledge.
