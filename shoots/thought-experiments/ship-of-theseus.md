# Ship of Theseus

The Ship of Theseus is a thought experiment, or paradox, from ancient Greek philosophy. At its core, it is an exploration of identity and change, posing the question of whether an object that has had all its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object.

### Description

According to the legend, Theseus, the mythical founder-king of Athens, had a ship which was kept in the harbour as a museum piece. Over time, the wooden parts of the ship began to decay and were replaced with new ones. Eventually, every single piece of the original ship was replaced. This prompts the question: Is this renovated ship still the same ship that Theseus sailed, or is it a different ship entirely?

This is not a mere question about the naming of objects but a profound inquiry into the nature of identity - what makes something essentially what it is. If something's parts are replaced, bit by bit, is there a point at which it becomes something else entirely, even if it retains its form? Or does the continuity of form and function maintain the identity of the original, regardless of the replacement of all its parts?

### Discussion Guide

The Ship of Theseus thought experiment provides fertile ground for philosophical dialogue and can stimulate meaningful discussion on various topics. Here are some questions that could guide a Socratic dialogue:

1. What does it mean for something to remain the same? Is physical continuity necessary, or can memory or record serve as the basis of identity?
2. How much can something change before it becomes something else? Is there a quantifiable threshold?
3. In your view, is the renovated ship still the Ship of Theseus? Why or why not?
4. Can you think of other examples, aside from the Ship of Theseus?

### Key arguments and considerations

The debate around the Ship of Theseus has no definitive answer and is open to interpretation, usually divided into four main considerations:

1. **No Identity Over Time**: Argues that since every part of the ship has been replaced, it is not the same ship. This viewpoint suggests there's no such thing as identity persistence over time.
2. **Identity Through Continuity**: Suggests that even though all the parts are replaced, the identity of the ship is preserved through continuity. It's the same ship because it maintains the same form and function.
3. **Identity Through Memory or Record**: Claims the ship remains the same because we remember it as the same ship or have a record of its progression over time.
4. **Identity as a Matter of Convention**: Posits that the identity of the ship is purely conventional or subjective, and it is up to us to decide whether it's the same ship or not.

### Applications in everyday life

The Ship of Theseus thought experiment can provide insightful perspectives on real-life issues such as personal identity, societal changes, and the nature of objects and systems.

* **Personal Identity**: Consider a human being over the course of their life. From childhood to old age, every cell in our body eventually gets replaced. Are we, then, the same person throughout our life? If not, when do we stop being who we were? This paradox encourages reflection on personal identity and continuity over time.
* **Societal Changes**: Similarly, societies change over time. Laws, customs, and people change. If a society's norms and people completely transform over a span of centuries, is it still the same society? How much change can a society endure while still maintaining its identity?
* **Objects and Systems**: In technology and business, we often update and replace components of a machine or parts of a business model. This paradox can help us question at what point does the change become so substantial that we must consider it a new system or a different machine altogether?
