# Categorical/Modal

### What is categorical/modal?

The categorical and the modal are two different modes of thinking that we use in our daily lives, often without even realising it.

**Categorical thinking** is about dealing with the world as it is. When we use categorical thinking, we're making statements about what is or isn't the case, based on the facts as we understand them. For example, if I say, "It's raining outside," I'm making a categorical statement about the current weather. It simply states a fact, without any indication of possibility, probability, or necessity. Categorical thinking is especially relevant in situations where we need to make sense of concrete data or facts.&#x20;

**Modal thinking**, on the other hand, is about possibilities, potentialities, and what could be. Modal thinking is often expressed through modal verbs like "can," "could," "may," "might," "must," "shall," "should," "will," and "would." For example, "the cat could be on the mat" or "the cat must be on the mat" are modal statements. They involve the modes or ways in which something can exist or take place. When we engage in modal thinking, we're considering various scenarios and outcomes, not just what is currently the case.&#x20;

### How to apply it in everyday life

Here are some ways how understanding this distinction can impact various aspects of our daily lives:

<details>

<summary>Communication</summary>

When we communicate, we're often switching between categorical and modal language. If someone says, "I am cooking dinner," that's a categorical statement. But if they say, "I could cook dinner," or "I should cook dinner," those are modal statements, expressing possibility and obligation respectively.

<summary>Decision-making</summary>

In making decisions, we often need to consider both the facts at hand (categorical) and the possible outcomes (modal). If you're deciding whether to take an umbrella, the categorical statement might be, "It's cloudy outside." But you would also consider the other possibility in the form of a modal statement, "It might rain."

<summary>Problem-solving</summary>

When solving problems, we start with categorical facts and use modal reasoning to explore solutions. For example, "The car won't start" is a categorical statement. "The car might start if we replace the battery" is a modal statement that guides us toward a potential solution.

<summary>Ethics and morality</summary>

This distinction can help us navigate moral dilemmas by distinguishing between absolute rules and potential exceptions. Consider the following perspectives on stealing:\
"Stealing is wrong" is a categorical claim, while "Stealing might be acceptable in desperate situations" is a modal claim.

<summary>Conflict resolution</summary>

When parties in conflict make categorical assertions ("You always...," "You never..."), it can escalate tensions. Encouraging modal thinking, on the other hand, opens up possibilities for resolution ("What if we tried...," "Could it help if we...").

### Key considerations and takeaways

Applying the distinction between categorical and modal statements can greatly enhance your reasoning skills. However, it's important to do so with an understanding of its limitations and potential pitfalls

Here are some tips and considerations to keep in mind:

<details>

<summary><strong>Context is key</strong></summary>

The meaning and implications of both categorical and modal statements often depend heavily on context. For example, the statement "You must stop at the red light" might seem categorical, but in certain emergency situations, it might be more accurately understood as modal: "You must stop at the red light, unless there's an emergency."

<details>

<summary><strong>Overreliance on Categorical Statements</strong></summary>

While categorical statements are essential for establishing facts, overreliance on them can lead to an oversimplified view of the world. Life is often more complex and uncertain than categorical statements suggest.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Overconfidence in Modal Statements</strong></summary>

Conversely, overconfidence in our modal judgments can also be a pitfall. Predicting possibilities and necessities is often harder than it seems. For example, many things that seem "impossible" are merely unlikely, and some things that seem "certain" are actually far from guaranteed.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Ambiguity in modal statements</strong></summary>

Modal statements can sometimes be ambiguous because they often involve subjective judgments or rely on unclear terms. For instance, if someone says, "It might rain later," it's not clear what "might" means. Does it imply a 50% chance? A 10% chance? Different people might interpret it differently.

By being aware of this difference, it encourages us to balance concrete facts with considerations of possibility and necessity, leading to a more nuanced understanding of the world.
