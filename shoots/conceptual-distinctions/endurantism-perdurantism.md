# Endurantism/Perdurantism

Endurantism and perdurantism are philosophical concepts that deal with how objects exist through time and how they are related to their parts and properties.

### What is endurantism/perdurantism?

**Endurantism** views that objects are wholly present at every moment of their existence. For endurantists, an object does not have temporal parts, but rather it's entirely itself at each point in time.&#x20;

Think of a tree: an endurantist would say the tree is fully present whether you're observing it as a seedling, a mature tree, or an old tree. Its changes in shape, size, or color are just different properties it has at different times.

**Perdurantism**, on the other hand, views objects as having different temporal parts at different times, much like a movie is made up of distinct frames. From this perspective, an object at one time is not entirely the same object at another time, as it is composed of different temporal segments.&#x20;

Considering the tree example again, a perdurantist would argue that the seedling, the mature tree, and the old tree are different temporal parts of the tree's life.

### How to apply it in everyday life

Let's explore how these concepts apply to various aspects of daily life:

<details>

<summary>Ethics</summary>

Endurantism influences our understanding of identity and persistence. Consider an example in the context of ethical reasoning. We may consider a person responsible for their past actions because they are fundamentally the same entity over time.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Decision-making</summary>

Perdurantism can influence how we approach change and development. In this context, it might lead us to consider the impact of our choices on our future selves as if they are distinct from our current self, promoting a more dynamic and forward-looking perspective.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Learning</summary>

Applying endurantism, we can understand a person's accumulation of knowledge and skills, seeing each stage of growth as part of the whole, enduring person.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Conflict resolution</summary>

By applying perdurantism, we can perceive individuals as a series of temporal parts. This understanding can help in acknowledging change and growth in people, potentially offering a more flexible and forgiving viewpoint.

### Key considerations and takeaways



Here are some guidelines on how to use these distinctions effectively:

<details>

<summary>Self-perception and growth</summary>

Endurantism can foster a sense of continuity and identity, which is essential for self-esteem and psychological well-being.&#x20;

At the same time, embracing perdurantism can encourage personal growth and adaptability by recognizing that one's future self can be different, and potentially better, than the current self.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Overemphasis on Continuity and Change</strong></summary>

Relying too much on endurantism can lead to resistance to change and growth, while an excessive focus on perdurantism might result in a fragmented sense of self or lack of responsibility for past actions.

This is not to say that both approaches are bad. Rather, they offer different perspectives of approaching the issue at hand.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Ethics and responsibility</strong></summary>

In ethical considerations, endurantism emphasises on personal responsibility over time. It's important in legal contexts and moral judgments.&#x20;

On the other hand, perdurantism can introduce a nuanced view, acknowledging that people change and that one's past self might be quite different from the present self, affecting how we judge past actions.

Taking it to the extreme, endurantism could lead to harsh judgments for past actions, while perdurantism might be used to evade responsibility.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Resolving conflicts</summary>

Understanding both perspectives can aid in resolving conflicts by acknowledging the enduring aspects of personalities and relationships (endurantism), while also recognizing the potential for change and different perspectives over time (perdurantism).

</details>

While endurantism emphasizes continuity and identity, perdurantism highlights change and development. Both perspectives offer valuable insights into how we perceive ourselves and the world around us, impacting various aspects of our daily lives, from how we make ethical decisions to how we resolve conflicts and embrace personal growth and learning.
