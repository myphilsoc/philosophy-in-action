# Absolute/Relative

Absolute and Relative are fundamental philosophical concepts that we encounter in numerous contexts, from ethics and morality to the sciences and everyday decision-making. Simply put, an absolute conception refers to something that is independent of anything else and remains unchanging regardless of perspective or context. A relative conception, on the other hand, describes something that changes based on perspective, comparison, or context. It is relational and dependent on something else for its definition.

Here's are some ways we apply this distinction in everyday life:

<summary>Communication</summary>

When we talk about "absolute" in communication, we're referring to definitive, clear-cut statements or facts. For example, the statement "the Earth orbits the Sun" is an absolute because it is unchanging and universally true, regardless of perspective.&#x20;

On the other hand, "relative" communication might involve statements like "I feel hot today." This is relative because the perception of temperature can vary from person to person, dependent on individual thresholds of heat or cold.

<summary>Decision-making</summary>

In decision-making, an absolute approach refers to decisions made based on fixed rules or principles. For example, "I will always tell the truth, no matter what" illustrates an absolute decision-making philosophy.&#x20;

A relative approach, in contrast, means making decisions based on the specific situation or context. For instance, you might decide to withhold a harsh truth to prevent hurting someone's feelings, considering the emotional impact relative to the situation.

<summary>Critical thinking</summary>

When we approach a problem from an absolute perspective, we tend to rely on established rules or universal truths. For instance, in a mathematical problem, the laws of mathematics are absolute - they do not change based on context.&#x20;

On the other hand, a relative perspective in critical thinking might consider multiple viewpoints and the specific context. For instance, in a social science discussion, one's viewpoint can be relative to their personal experiences or cultural background.

<summary>Ethics and morality</summary>

Absolute notions of morality would argue for the existence of universal moral laws that apply to all individuals, cultures, and times. For instance, the belief that stealing is wrong, regardless of context, is an example of absolute morality.&#x20;

Relative notions of morality, on the other hand, would argue that moral standards can change across different cultures and contexts. For instance, certain societies might view stealing as acceptable in extreme situations of need or survival.

Understanding the distinction between absolute and relative is not just about acknowledging their existence but also learning how to apply these concepts effectively in our daily lives.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
While the relative perspective is important for considering various viewpoints, it's also critical not to fall into the trap of **extreme relativism**, where everything is viewed as subjective. This could lead to a dismissive attitude towards universally accepted facts or a reluctance to judge harmful behaviors. Maintaining a balance between acknowledging the validity of different perspectives while upholding universal moral or ethical principles is key.
{% endhint %}

Here are some areas where it's important to apply the distinction thoughtfully:

* **Identifying the Context**\
  Whether to apply an absolute or relative perspective often depends on the context. In situations where universal truths or unchanging facts are involved, like in mathematics or physics, an absolute viewpoint is necessary. However, in more subjective fields like ethics, decision-making, and communication, a relative perspective often provides a more nuanced and holistic approach. The key is to understand which perspective is most appropriate for the given situation.
* **Respecting Diversity**\
  When dealing with cultural or individual differences, a relative perspective is crucial. People's values, behaviors, and beliefs are often shaped by their personal experiences and cultural backgrounds, and it's important to respect this diversity. Insisting on an absolute perspective in such cases can lead to conflict, misunderstandings, or the marginalization of certain perspectives.
* **Unchanging Core Values**\
  Absolute principles can often serve as the unchanging core values that guide us in life. For instance, a person might absolutely value honesty, respect, or kindness. However, how these principles are practiced might change in a relative context. For example, the way we demonstrate respect might differ based on cultural norms or personal preferences.
* **Flexibility**\
  The world is complex and often demands a flexible approach. An absolute perspective might provide consistency and clarity, but it can also lead to rigidity and close-mindedness. It's important to be open to changing our perspectives when new information comes to light, which is a cornerstone of the relative approach.
* **Uncertainty**\
  One limitation of the relative perspective is that it can sometimes lead to uncertainty or paralysis, especially in decision-making. If every decision depends on the specific context or perspective, it might be challenging to arrive at a clear choice. Sometimes, a balance of both perspectives might be needed.

By recognizing when to apply an absolute versus a relative perspective, we can better navigate our interactions, decisions, and problem-solving efforts. It encourages us to be flexible yet principled, helping us to adapt to varying circumstances while upholding core values.
