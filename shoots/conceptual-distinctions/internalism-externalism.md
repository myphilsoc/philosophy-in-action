# Internalism/Externalism

In philosophy, the terms internalism and externalism refer to how various human faculties, like knowledge, justification, or moral values, are influenced by factors inside or outside the individual's own mind.

### What is internalism/externalism?

**Internalism** posits that all the factors needed for a particular state, like knowledge or moral judgment, are internally accessible. In other words, if you're an internalist about knowledge, you believe that everything you need to justify your knowledge (reasons, evidence, etc.) is accessible through introspection or reflection.

**Externalism**, in contrast, argues that factors outside the individual's own mind can be just as essential. For knowledge, this might mean that the environment or context plays a crucial role in justifying beliefs, beyond what the individual is directly aware of.

### How to apply it in everyday life

Let's explore how these concepts apply to various aspects of daily life:

<details>

<summary>Communication</summary>

Internalism emphasizes the importance of personal conviction and understanding in communication.&#x20;

For instance, before expressing an opinion, an internalist would reflect deeply to ensure their views are well-founded and coherent with their personal beliefs and knowledge.

<details>

<summary>Decision-making</summary>

Externalism recognizes the importance of external factors and feedback in shaping decisions. It suggests that good decision-making often involves considering external evidence and advice, not just internal reasoning and values.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Ethics and morality</summary>

Externalism might stress the role of societal norms and external consequences in shaping moral judgments. It recognizes that moral understanding and decisions are often deeply influenced by the external social context.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Learning</summary>

In learning, internalism would stress the importance of personal understanding and mastery. It's not just about having information but truly comprehending and integrating it internally.

### Key considerations and takeaways

Here are some guidelines on how to use these distinctions effectively:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Excessive focus on internal factors can lead to solipsism or confirmation bias, where one becomes closed off to new information or differing perspectives. It's crucial to remain open to external input to avoid these pitfalls.

Conversely, depending too much on external factors can lead to a lack of personal conviction or a disconnect from one's values and beliefs. It's important to not lose one's sense of self or personal judgment in the face of external pressures.

<summary><strong>Balanced decision-making</strong></summary>

Combine internal reflection with external information. For critical decisions, weigh your internal convictions and reasoning against external evidence and perspectives to reach a well-rounded conclusion.

This also applies in ethical considerations too. Balancing your personal moral intuitions (internalism) with societal norms and consequences (externalism) can lead to more socially responsible and widely accepted moral decisions.

<details>

<summary>Accessibility of experience</summary>

Not all experiences can be personally had, and not all concepts can be fully understood through description alone. Recognizing this limitation is crucial for humility and open-mindedness.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Bias and subjectivity</strong></summary>

Both types of knowledge are susceptible to personal biases. Descriptions can be biased by the speaker's perspective, and personal experiences are inherently subjective. Being aware of these biases is essential for critical thinking and analysis.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Communication barriers</summary>

Conveying knowledge by acquaintance to others can be challenging since it's deeply personal and subjective. Finding ways to effectively communicate these experiences, perhaps by coupling them with descriptions, is crucial for mutual understanding.

Also when interacting with others, it's essential to remember that your acquaintance with their experiences is often limited. Assuming you fully understand someone else's situation based solely on description can hinder genuine empathy and communication.
