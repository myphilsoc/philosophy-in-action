# de re/de dicto

The terms "de re" and "de dicto" are Latin phrases used in philosophy to distinguish between two types of knowledge or belief.

De re (pronounced "duh-ray") translates to "about the thing" and refers to statements that are about objects or things in the world. For example, if I say, "My car is blue," I'm making a de re statement about a specific object in the worldâ€”my car.

On the other hand, "de dicto" translates to "about what is said" and refers to statements about the content of a proposition or belief. For example, if I say, "I believe that all cars are blue," I'm making a de dicto statement about a belief or proposition, not about a specific object in the world.

Here are some ways we apply this distinction in everyday life:

<summary>Communication</summary>

When we communicate, we often switch between de re and de dicto statements without even realizing it. Understanding the difference can help us be more precise in our language. For example, if someone says, "I believe in love," are they making a de re statement about a specific instance of love they've experienced (e.g., their love for their partner), or a de dicto statement about the concept of love in general?&#x20;

Now consider another instance where you're discussing a movie with a friend who hasn't seen it yet. You might say, "The lead actor was great!" This is a de re comment: you're talking about a specific person, the lead actor. But if you say, "The actor who plays James Bond is always great," you're making a de dicto comment: you're speaking about the proposition of the actor playing James Bond.

Clarifying such notions can lead to more effective communication.

<summary>Decision-making</summary>

When we make decisions, we often have to weigh specific, concrete factors (de re) against more abstract principles or beliefs (de dicto). For example, you might believe in the importance of environmental sustainability (de dicto), but when deciding whether to buy a new car, you have to consider specific factors like cost, convenience, and the car's fuel efficiency (de re).\

Consider another example. Suppose you're deciding whether to buy a certain brand of cereal. If you think, "I want to buy this because it's healthy," you're making a de dicto decision, based on the proposition that the cereal is healthy. However, if you think, "I want to buy this because I liked the last cereal from this brand," you're making a de re decision, based on your experience with a specific object - the previous cereal brand.

<summary>Critical thinking</summary>

Understanding the de re/de dicto distinction can help us analyze arguments more effectively by distinguishing between claims about specific things and claims about general principles or beliefs.&#x20;

If someone claims, "Drinking coffee is unhealthy," we should consider whether this is a de re or de dicto claim. Is the person making a general statement about all coffee (de dicto), or are they referring to a specific type or quantity of coffee (de re)? Recognizing this distinction can help us question and understand claims more effectively.

<summary>Ethics and morality</summary>

When thinking about what's right or wrong, we often switch between de re and de dicto considerations. For instance, if someone argues "stealing is wrong" (a de dicto claim about a general principle), we might challenge this with a de re consideration: "What about stealing to feed a starving child?" Here, we're referring to a specific instance of stealing, not the general proposition.

<summary>Conflict resolution</summary>

Understanding these distinctions can aid in resolving misunderstandings. For example, when two people argue over a statement like "John is a good person," they might be talking past each other if one is making a de re claim (referring to specific actions or traits of John) while the other is making a de dicto claim (referring to the general notion of what constitutes a good person).

Understanding the de re and de dicto distinction is one thing, but using it effectively is another.&#x20;

Here are some tips and considerations to keep in mind:

<details>

<summary><strong>Clarity of Communication</strong></summary>

It's important to be aware of when you're using de re or de dicto modes of speech, especially in complex or nuanced conversations. Misunderstandings can easily arise if one person is speaking de re and the other de dicto. Therefore, clarity in communication is paramount. This may involve **explicitly stating whether you're discussing a general proposition or a specific instance.**

<summary><strong>Context Sensitivity</strong></summary>

The distinction between de re and de dicto can sometimes be a matter of interpretation and can depend heavily on the context. For instance, if someone says, "The president is a good leader," this could be taken as a de re claim about the current president, or a de dicto claim about the role of president in general. Be mindful of context when interpreting and making these kinds of statements.

<summary>Misuse and manipulation</summary>

The de re/de dicto distinction can be misused in arguments or discussions. For example, someone might use a de dicto claim (e.g., "Politicians from the X Party are dishonest") to justify a de re judgment about a specific politician. It's important to be aware of this potential for manipulation and to call it out when you see it.

<summary><strong>Ambiguity</strong></summary>

The de re/de dicto distinction is not always clear-cut. Some statements can be interpreted as either de re or de dicto. For instance, if someone says "I love New York," this could be a de re claim about their feelings towards the specific city, or a de dicto claim about their feelings towards cities like New York. Furthermore, this distinction doesn't cover all aspects of belief and language. There are many other factors at play, such as the speaker's intentions, the listener's interpretations, cultural contexts, and more.

Using the de re and de dicto distinction effectively requires understanding its nuances, being sensitive to context, and being aware of its limitations. This can help enhance our communication, critical thinking, decision-making, and understanding of ethics and morality, among other aspects of our lives.
