# Necessary/Contingent

### What is necessary/contingent?

Something is considered necessary if it must be the case; it cannot be otherwise. This necessity can be logical (e.g., mathematical truths like 2+2=4), metaphysical (e.g., the existence of space for physical objects), or even ethical (e.g., moral truths, if one believes in them)..

In contrast, something is contingent if it can be otherwise; it is not bound to be the case. Contingent facts or events depend on other factors and could have been different under different circumstances (e.g., it’s raining today, but it could have been sunny).

### How to apply it in everyday life

Let's explore how this distinction can be applied to various aspects of daily life:

<details>

<summary>Critical thinking</summary>

In evaluating arguments or theories, discerning between necessary premises (those that must be true for the argument to hold) and contingent ones can help in assessing the strength and validity of the argument.&#x20;

For instance, recognizing that it's necessary for a triangle to have three sides, but contingent whether it's equilateral, can help in geometric problem-solving.

<summary>Decision-making</summary>

Understanding necessity and contingency can sharpen decision-making skills.&#x20;

One can easily apply this distinction by weighing the necessary outcomes against the contingent ones. This helps in prioritizing actions that ensure essential needs or goals are met before addressing less critical, contingent factors.

For example, if you know that getting a certain amount of sleep is necessary for your health, you might prioritize it over contingent events like watching a late-night movie, which you could do any other time.

<summary>Learning</summary>

Grasping the necessary components of a subject (fundamental principles) versus the contingent ones (context-specific facts) can enhance one’s understanding and ability to apply knowledge effectively.

<summary>Conflict resolution</summary>

Recognizing the necessary (non-negotiable values or needs) versus the contingent (preferences that can be adjusted) can be vital in reaching a resolution that respects all parties' core concerns while allowing flexibility in less crucial areas.

### Key considerations and takeaways

Here are some guidelines on how to use these distinctions effectively:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Be cautious not to overgeneralize the notion of necessity. What might seem necessary in one context or worldview might not be universally so. Cultural, individual, and contextual differences can turn what some view as necessary into something contingent.

While it's crucial to identify and respect what is necessary, it's also important not to neglect the contingent aspects. Sometimes, the richness of an experience, relationship, or decision comes from its contingent, unique attributes.

<summary>Contextual awareness</summary>

The line between what is necessary and what is contingent can often be blurred and highly context-dependent. A keen sensitivity to the specific context and a readiness to reevaluate what you consider necessary or contingent is crucial.

Sometimes, necessary and contingent factors are deeply intertwined. For example, while the need for social interaction may be necessary for human wellbeing, the specific forms and norms of interaction are contingent, varying across cultures and individuals.

<summary><strong>Limitation in predictive power</strong></summary>

Recognizing something as necessary or contingent does not always predict future occurrences or truths. Especially with contingent factors, there's an inherent unpredictability that one must be prepared to accept and adapt to.

<details>

<summary>Ethical complexity</summary>

In ethics, the distinction between necessary and contingent can become highly complex and contested. What one culture or individual deems a necessary moral truth, another might see as contingent. This requires a careful, empathetic, and dialogic approach in moral reasoning and ethical decision-making.

One way to approach this is to distinguish between what is morally necessary (perhaps duties or rights) and what is morally contingent (perhaps cultural norms or personal preferences). This can aid in making decisions that are just and respectful of universal moral principles while being sensitive to contextual factors.

</details>

While the distinction between necessary and contingent is a powerful tool in understanding and navigating the world, its effective use requires mindfulness, contextual awareness, and a readiness to acknowledge and engage with complexity and diversity.&#x20;

It's not just about categorizing aspects of reality or thought but about using these categories to think, decide, and act more clearly, responsibly, and compassionately.
