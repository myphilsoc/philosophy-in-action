# Induction

Induction is a way of thinking that helps us make general conclusions or predictions based on specific observations or experiences. It's like looking at a few pieces of a puzzle and trying to guess what the whole picture might be. In inductive reasoning, the conclusions we reach might be likely or probable, but they're not guaranteed to be true.

Here's a simple example to illustrate induction:\
Observation 1: The sun rises in the east every day.\
Observation 2: The sun has risen in the east for as long as you can remember.\
Conclusion: The sun will likely rise in the east tomorrow.

In everyday life, we use induction to make predictions, form beliefs, and learn from our experiences. Here are a few examples:

<details>

<summary>Cooking</summary>

You've tried a few recipes from a particular cookbook, and they all turned out great. You conclude that other recipes from the same book are likely to be good as well.

<details>

<summary>Predicting traffic</summary>

You notice that the traffic is usually heavy during rush hour. Based on this observation, you predict that there will be traffic during rush hour tomorrow and plan your commute accordingly.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Social situations</summary>

You've observed that when you smile at people, they often smile back. You start smiling at strangers, expecting them to smile back most of the time.

Keep in mind that induction relies on the observations and experiences we have. If our observations are limited or biased, our conclusions might not be accurate. Nevertheless, induction is useful in our everyday lives because it allows us to make educated guesses and form reasonable expectations based on the information we have.
