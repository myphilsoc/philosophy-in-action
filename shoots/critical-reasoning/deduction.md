# Deduction

### What is deduction?

Deduction is a way of thinking that helps us reach conclusions based on given information or premises. It's like a puzzle, where you put the pieces together to form a complete picture. In deductive reasoning, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true as well. If the premises are incorrect or incomplete, the conclusions may not be accurate.

Here's a simple example to illustrate deduction:\
Premise 1: All humans need water to survive.\
Premise 2: John is a human.\
Conclusion: John needs water to survive.

### How to apply deduction in everyday life

In everyday life, we use deduction to make decisions, solve problems, and understand the world around us. Here are a few examples:

<details>

<summary>Meal planning</summary>

There are spaghetti noodles, tomato sauce, and cheese in your kitchen. You deduce that you can make a pasta dish for dinner.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Weather</summary>

If the weather forecast says it will rain today and you trust the forecast, you deduce that you should take an umbrella when you go outside.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Health advice</summary>

You learn that regular exercise is good for your health. You start exercising regularly to deduce that you'll improve your overall well-being.

Ultimately, deduction helps us navigate our daily lives by drawing logical conclusions based on the information we already have.
