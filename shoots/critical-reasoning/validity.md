# Validity

### What is validity?

Validity is a concept that helps us determine whether an argument or a line of reasoning is logical and well-structured. In simple terms, an argument is valid if the conclusion follows logically from the premises, meaning that if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true as well.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Validity is about the structure of the argument, not the actual truth of the premises or conclusion.
{% endhint %}

Here's a simple example to illustrate validity:\
Premise 1: All dogs are mammals. \
Premise 2: Rover is a dog. \
Conclusion: Rover is a mammal.

### How to apply validity in everyday life

In everyday life, we use the concept of validity to evaluate the strength of arguments or reasoning, which helps us make informed decisions and better understand the world around us. \
Here are a few examples:

<details>

<summary>Debates and discussions</summary>

When engaging in a debate or listening to someone's argument, you assess the validity of their reasoning to determine if their conclusions are logically sound. (see [_Soundness_](soundness.md))

</details>

<details>

<summary>Problem-solving</summary>

When trying to solve a problem or make a decision, you examine different arguments and options by evaluating their validity to choose the most logical course of action.&#x20;

For instance, let's say you're deciding on a new home. You consider various factors: proximity to work, affordability, neighbourhood safety, and potential for future value increase. You discard options that are too far from work, which doesn't align with your need for a short commute. You then evaluate affordability and safety, and prioritise homes in safe neighborhoods within your budget. Finally, you choose the home with the highest potential for value increase, as this is the most logical choice based on your evaluations.

<summary>Critical thinking</summary>

Developing strong critical thinking skills involves being able to recognise valid arguments and distinguish them from those that are flawed or poorly structured.

### Key considerations and takeaways

{% hint style="warning" %}
Be cautious when accepting the conclusion of an argument based solely on its validity. It's not just about whether the idea makes sense, it's also about whether the premises are true. Like if someone says: \
"**All birds fly. Penguins are birds. So, penguins must fly.**" \
This is valid, but it's wrong because **not all birds fly, like penguins**. Always make sure the premises are true before you believe the conclusion.
{% endhint %}

Understanding the concept of validity helps us become more discerning thinkers and communicators, allowing us to evaluate the strength of arguments and make better decisions based on sound reasoning.
