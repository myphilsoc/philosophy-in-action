# Soundness

Validity is a concept that helps us determine whether an argument or a line of reasoning is logical and well-structured. In simple terms, an argument is valid if the conclusion follows logically from the premises, meaning that if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true as well.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Validity is about the structure of the argument, not the actual truth of the premises or conclusion.
{% endhint %}

Here's a simple example to illustrate validity:\
Premise 1: All dogs are mammals. \
Premise 2: Rover is a dog. \
Conclusion: Rover is a mammal.

In everyday life, we use the concept of validity to evaluate the strength of arguments or reasoning, which helps us make informed decisions and better understand the world around us. \
Here are a few examples:

<summary>Debates and discussions</summary>

When engaging in a debate or listening to someone's argument, you assess the validity of their reasoning to determine if their conclusions are logically sound.

<summary>Predicting traffic</summary>

You notice that the traffic is usually heavy during rush hour. Based on this observation, you predict that there will be traffic during rush hour tomorrow and plan your commute accordingly.

<details>

<summary>Social situations</summary>

You've observed that when you smile at people, they often smile back. You start smiling at strangers, expecting them to smile back most of the time.

Keep in mind that induction relies on the observations and experiences we have. If our observations are limited or biased, our conclusions might not be accurate. Nevertheless, induction is useful in our everyday lives because it allows us to make educated guesses and form reasonable expectations based on the information we have.
