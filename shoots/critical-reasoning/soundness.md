# Soundness

Soundness is a concept that helps us determine whether an argument is not only logical and well-structured but also based on true premises. In simple terms, an argument is sound if it is valid (meaning the conclusion follows logically from the premises) and all the premises are true.&#x20;

When an argument is sound, it guarantees that the conclusion is also true.

Here's a simple example to illustrate soundness:\
Premise 1: All humans are mortal. \
Premise 2: Ben is a human being. \
Conclusion: Ben is mortal.

In this case, the argument is not only valid (the conclusion follows logically from the premises), but it is also sound because both premises are true, ensuring the truth of the conclusion.

In everyday life, we use the concept of soundness to assess the reliability of arguments and make informed decisions based on them. \
Here are a few examples:

When presenting your own arguments or opinions, ensuring they are sound helps you to be more persuasive and convincing, as your reasoning will be based on true premises and logical structure.

In everyday life, understanding the concept of soundness helps us become more discerning thinkers and communicators. It allows us to evaluate the strength and reliability of arguments, make better decisions based on accurate information, and engage in more effective and persuasive communication.
