# Malaysian Philosophy Society

## Who we are

We are a grassroots philosophy society based in Malaysia. Our members are people from all walks of life united by a single mission to make philosophy practical and accessible to all.

## Journey to Inception

We were working on refining our vision by developing a framework on philosophical practice. This framework would inform why we do what we do. During that period of research, we realised that such resources weren't easily accessible through a Google search.&#x20;

Everything was all spread out across different sources. It was then that we realised that this vision we were trying to achieve is beyond our means. Which is why decided to transform our initial work into an open-source wiki.&#x20;

By leveraging on open-source infrastructure, it allows us to tap on the collective intelligence and be part of the collaborative commons. This enables us to make resources on philosophical practice available to not only the stakeholders that we work with, but also to the wider, global community.
