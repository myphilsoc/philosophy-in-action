# ðŸ“œ Manifesto of the Everyday Philosopher

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember, like all manifestos, this one too is not set in stone. It's designed to guide us, but not to dictate our actions. As the world around us changes, our understanding evolves, and our perspectives shift, so too might the principles in this manifesto.&#x20;

Being an Everyday Philosopher means not following a set of rules, but continually questioning, learning, and adapting. So, while we encourage you to embrace these principles, we also urge you to never follow them blindly. Stay flexible, stay curious, and stay open to the ever-evolving journey of philosophical exploration.
