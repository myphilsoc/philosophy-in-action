# Essential/Accidental

### What are essential and accidental properties?

Essential properties are characteristics that define an entity's identity. Without them, the entity would not be what it fundamentally is. For example, the ability to reason is an essential property of being human. Without the capacity for rational thought, the concept of "human" would be entirely different.

In our daily lives, recognizing essential properties helps us understand the core of what or who something truly is. This can be crucial in areas like ethics and morality. For instance, if we consider empathy an essential property of a moral individual, then actions lacking empathy may lead us to question the morality of the individual involved.

Accidental properties are characteristics that an entity has, but they do not define the entity's essence. These can change without altering the fundamental nature of the entity. For example, having brown hair is an accidental property of a person. Changing hair color doesn't change the person's identity as a human being.

Understanding accidental properties is useful in areas like conflict resolution and critical thinking. When we recognize that certain traits or behaviors are accidental and not essential, we can avoid unnecessary conflicts and focus on what truly matters. For example, disagreeing with someone's choice of clothing (an accidental property) should not lead to questioning their core values or identity (their essential properties).

### How to apply it in everyday life

Let's explore how these concepts apply to various aspects of daily life:

<details>

<summary>Communication</summary>

Recognizing the essential and accidental in conversations can improve understanding and empathy.&#x20;

When you focus on essential qualities, you see beyond the surface level and appreciate the person for their inherent traits and the depth of your relationship.&#x20;

For example, consider two friends, Alex and Jamie. They have a deep bond based on mutual respect, support during difficult times, and shared life goals. These are the essentials of their friendship. Even when Alex moves to a different city for work, the essential qualities of their friendship don't change. Despite the physical distance, their connection remains strong because it's based on more than just proximity or common routines; it's rooted in the fundamental aspects of their relationship.

On the other hand, acknowledging accidental attributes allows you to appreciate the diversity in others without letting these differences negatively impact your perception of them.&#x20;

For instance, Alex loves rock music while Jamie prefers classical. Initially, Jamie might feel that this difference makes them less compatible as friends. However, by recognizing that musical preference is an accidental attribute and not essential to their friendship's core, Jamie avoids making a superficial judgment. Instead, Jamie appreciates the diversity Alex brings into their life, and they both learn to enjoy some new experiences without letting these preferences define or limit their friendship.

<summary>Decision-making</summary>

Distinguishing between what is essential and what is accidental can lead to more informed and sustainable choices. For example, when choosing a job, understanding whether job satisfaction (essential) or a high salary (potentially accidental) is more important to you can guide your decision-making process.

<summary>Learning</summary>

Distinguishing between essential concepts or components and accidental ones can help prioritize learning objectives or solutions. Focusing on essential principles in a subject can lead to a deeper and more structured understanding, while recognizing accidental information can prevent overloading with irrelevant details.

### Key considerations and takeaways



Here are some guidelines on how to use these distinctions effectively:

<details>

<summary>Avoid oversimplification</summary>

Essentialist thinking can sometimes lead to oversimplification, where complex entities or ideas are reduced to a few characteristics, potentially overlooking important nuances.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Context Matters</strong></summary>

What is considered essential or accidental can vary greatly depending on the context or perspective.

Always consider the context in which you're applying these distinctions. For example, in art, a color might be accidental in one style but essential in another, depending on the artist's intention or the art movement's characteristics.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Dynamic nature of properties</strong></summary>

Rapid changes in fields like technology and culture can shift what is considered essential or accidental. For instance, certain features of a smartphone might be deemed essential today but could become obsolete (and thus accidental) in the future.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Falling into stereotypes</summary>

Misapplying these distinctions, especially in social or ethical contexts, can lead to stereotypes or discrimination, as it might involve oversimplifying or misjudging the essence of a group or individual.

It is crucial to use these distinctions responsibly, especially when dealing with people or cultures. Recognize the unique and complex nature of human identity and avoid reducing individuals to a set of characteristics.
