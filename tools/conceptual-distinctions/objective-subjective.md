# Objective/Subjective

### What is objective/subjective?

**Objectivity** is the aspect of perceiving and evaluating things based on observable, measurable facts without personal bias or emotion. It emphasizes a stance that is universally true, regardless of individual perspectives.&#x20;

For example, stating "The temperature is 32°C" is objective as it is a measurable fact.

**Subjectivity** is the aspect of interpretation, opinion, or perspective that is influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or experiences.&#x20;

An example would be saying, "Today's weather is uncomfortably hot." This statement reflects a personal experience of the temperature.

### How to apply it in everyday life

Let's explore how this distinction can be applied to various aspects of daily life:

<details>

<summary>Communication</summary>

Objectivity in communication involves sticking to facts, data, and observable phenomena. This approach is essential in scientific discussions, news reporting, and technical writing.&#x20;

Subjectivity in communication allows for personal expression and can be vital in artistic endeavors, personal storytelling, and expressing empathy.&#x20;

For instance, a journalist reports events objectively, whereas a novelist may describe the same events subjectively to convey emotions.

<summary>Critical thinking</summary>

Objectivity in critical thinking involves evaluating arguments based on evidence and logic, free from personal bias. It's crucial in scientific research and academic scholarship.&#x20;

Subjectively, critical thinking can involve personal interpretations and creative problem-solving, often seen in fields like literature analysis or ethical discussions.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Decision-making</summary>

Objective decision-making relies on factual information and logical analysis, crucial in business, law, and medicine. For example, a doctor choosing a treatment based on clinical evidence.&#x20;

Subjective decision-making incorporates personal beliefs, preferences, and values, which is important in personal life choices like choosing a career based on personal passion.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Ethics and morality</summary>

Objectivity in ethics seeks universal principles applicable to everyone, like human rights.&#x20;

Subjectively, ethics can involve personal moral beliefs and cultural values, which vary significantly among individuals and societies.&#x20;

For example, objective ethics might condemn stealing under any circumstance, whereas subjective ethics might consider stealing to feed a starving family as morally acceptable.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Conflict resolution</summary>

Objectivity is crucial in mediating conflicts, where a neutral stance based on facts is necessary.&#x20;

Subjectivity allows understanding individual emotional responses and personal experiences, helping to empathize with conflicting parties.

</details>

### Key considerations and takeaways

Here are some guidelines on how to use these distinctions effectively:

{% hint style="warning" %}
While facts are crucial, overemphasizing objectivity can lead to disregarding personal experiences and emotions, which are also important in understanding the human aspect of any situation.

Just because something is subjective doesn't mean it's incorrect or invalid. Personal experiences and opinions are valid in their own right and should be respected.

<summary>Clear communication</summary>

Effective communication often requires distinguishing between facts (objective) and opinions (subjective). Misunderstandings can arise if this distinction is not clear. For instance, a statement like "The room is cold" can be perceived differently. Objectively, it might mean the temperature is below a certain degree, but subjectively, it might reflect an individual's comfort level.

Be clear about whether you are presenting facts or personal opinions. One way to do this is to being your statements with phrases like "Research shows…" for objective claims or "I feel…" for subjective viewpoints to avoid confusion.

<summary><strong>Intersubjectivity and Interobjectivity</strong></summary>

Objective and subjective perspectives are not always mutually exclusive. Understanding the interplay between the two can lead to a more nuanced understanding of issues.

An example of such interplay is found in the concepts of intersubjectivity and interobjectivity:

**Intersubjectivity** refers to the shared, mutual understanding or the common ground that people develop through interactions and communications. It acknowledges that our personal experiences (subjective) are not isolated but are influenced and shaped by our interactions with others and the society at large. Here are some implications from this perspective :

1. **Shared understanding**\
   Intersubjectivity allows individuals to transcend their personal, subjective viewpoints and reach a mutual understanding. For example, in a discussion, while each person may have their subjective opinions, through effective communication and empathy, they can arrive at a shared perspective that respects and incorporates individual views.
2. **Validating personal experiences**\
   While certain feelings or perceptions are personal, they can be understood and empathized with by others. This shared understanding can turn subjective experiences into a collective reality, giving them a form of objective validity within a group or society.
3. **Navigating social constructs**\
   Many societal norms and beliefs are not purely objective but are rather the result of intersubjective agreements. For instance, the value of money or the concept of justice isn't based on objective facts alone but on a collective agreement about what these concepts mean and how they should function in society.
4. **Challenging Objectivity**\
   Intersubjectivity challenges the notion of a fixed, universal objectivity. It suggests that what is considered objective can be influenced by the collective subjective perspectives of a society at a given time, and as these collective perspectives shift, so too can the understanding of what is objective.

Though not as commonly discussed as intersubjectivity. **Interobjectivity** refers to the shared reality constructed by objects and their interactions in the physical world, independent of human observation or interpretation. Here are some implications:

1. **Shared realities**\
   Just as intersubjectivity refers to a shared understanding among individuals, interobjectivity refers to the shared reality created by objects. For instance, road signs, maps, or clocks provide a consistent, objective framework within which people can coordinate and make sense of their subjective experiences.
2. **Behavior-influencing environments**\
   The material environment, structured by objects, influences human perceptions and behaviors. This suggests that our subjective experiences are not only shaped by interactions with other people (intersubjectivity) but also by interactions with the material world (interobjectivity).
3. **Value-embedded objects**\
   Objects often embody collective practices, norms, and values. For instance, the architecture of a building or the layout of a city reflects and reinforces certain social structures and cultural values, contributing to a form of objective reality that is collectively experienced and upheld.\
   \
   These also influence human relationships and communication. For example, the design of a social media platform (an object) influences how people interact with each other, shaping the intersubjective realm of human communication and relationships.

<summary>Valuing both perspectives</summary>

Recognize the importance of both objective facts and subjective experiences. While objective data provides a solid foundation for understanding, subjective insights add depth and personal relevance.

</details>

Distinguishing between objective and subjective elements is essential in navigating the complex web of human interaction and understanding. It fosters clearer communication, more informed decision-making, and a deeper understanding of personal versus shared realities.
