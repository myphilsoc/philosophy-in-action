# Analytic/Synthetic

### What is analytic/synthetic?

The distinction between analytic and synthetic is a central concept in philosophy, especially in understanding the nature of knowledge and belief.

Analytic statements are ones where the truth is contained within the statement itself. In other words, understanding the statement is enough to know that it is true. For example, the statement "all bachelors are unmarried men" is analytic. You don't need to meet every bachelor in the world to know this is true; by definition, a bachelor is an unmarried man.

On the other hand, synthetic statements are those where the truth isn't determined solely by the definitions of the words in the statement. These statements require some kind of experience or evidence beyond the statement itself to verify their truth. For instance, the statement "some bachelors are unhappy" is synthetic. You can't know whether it's true or false just by understanding the words; you would need to conduct some sort of survey or study to find out.

### How to apply it in everyday life

Here are some ways we apply this distinction in everyday life:

<details>

<summary>Communication</summary>

When we communicate, we often use both analytic and synthetic statements without even realizing it. For example, if someone says, "I'm a vegan, so I don't eat meat," that's an analytic statement; the definition of being a vegan includes not eating meat.&#x20;

On the other hand, if someone says, "I'm a vegan, and I feel healthier," that's a synthetic statement; the health benefits of veganism aren't included in the definition of being a vegan.

<summary>Decision-making</summary>

When making decisions, we often need to consider both types of statements. For instance, if you're deciding whether to buy a house, an analytic statement might be, "This house has three bedrooms." That's a factual statement based on the definition of a bedroom. But a synthetic statement like, "This house will be a good investment" requires additional information, like understanding the real estate market, to verify.

<summary>Critical thinking</summary>

Understanding the distinction between analytic and synthetic can help us evaluate arguments and identify fallacies. For example, if someone argues, "Smoking is unhealthy because it's bad for you," that's circular reasoning—an analytic statement that doesn't provide new information.&#x20;

A more compelling argument might be, "Smoking is unhealthy because studies show it increases the risk of lung cancer"—a synthetic statement backed by evidence.

<summary>Ethics and morality</summary>

When having discussions on what's right or wrong, distinguishing between analytic and synthetic statements can be crucial. For instance, "Killing is wrong" is often treated as an analytic statement in many moral systems. However, challenging statements like "Capital punishment is justified in some cases" would be synthetic, needing further argumentation and evidence to be convincing.

<summary>Problem-solving</summary>

In problem-solving, we need to understand the nature of the problem (often through analytic statements) and then devise solutions (usually requiring synthetic statements). For instance, understanding "A car engine needs fuel to run" (analytic) is different from figuring out "This car isn't running because it's out of fuel" (synthetic).

### Key considerations and takeaways

Using the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements effectively can enhance your understanding of the world and improve your critical thinking skills. However, like any tool, it must be used with care.&#x20;

Here are some tips and considerations:

<details>

<summary>Misclassification</summary>

Be careful not to misclassify statements. A common mistake is treating a synthetic statement as if it's analytic, or vice versa. This can lead to faulty reasoning.&#x20;

For example, consider the statement "All birds can fly." It might seem analytic because we often associate birds with flying. However, it's actually synthetic because there are birds, like penguins and ostriches, that can't fly.&#x20;

Misclassifying the statement could lead to incorrect assumptions or decisions.

<details>

<summary>Dependence on definitions</summary>

The truth of analytic statements hinges on the definitions of the words used. This means that disagreements about definitions can lead to disagreements about the truth of analytic statements. For instance, debates about moral and legal issues often involve disputes about how key terms are defined.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Uncertainty in synthetic statements</summary>

Synthetic statements often involve a degree of uncertainty because they rely on evidence or experience that may be incomplete or subject to change. For instance, scientific theories are typically based on synthetic statements, and they're often revised as new evidence becomes available.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Over-reliance on Analytic Statements</strong></summary>

While analytic statements are useful for establishing facts based on definitions, overreliance on them can lead to a lack of nuance or depth in understanding. Life's complexities often require synthetic reasoning, which involves evidence, context, and experience.

<summary>Quinean Critique</summary>

Philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine challenged the distinction between analytic and synthetic, arguing that it's not as clear or useful as many philosophers believe. According to Quine, our knowledge is a web of interconnected beliefs, and it's not always possible (or meaningful) to separate them neatly into analytic and synthetic categories. This critique is a reminder to use the distinction as a tool, not an absolute rule.

</details>

The distinction between analytic and synthetic allows us to better understand and navigate the complexities of our world. In fact, it has been useful in areas like philosophy, science, and law. But it's crucial to be aware of its limitations and potential pitfalls. With careful use, this distinction can greatly enhance your critical thinking skills.
