# Thompson's Violinist

Thompson's Violinist is a thought experiment introduced by American philosopher Judith Jarvis Thomson in 1971. It's widely used in ethical and philosophical discussions, primarily focusing on the morality of abortion, personal autonomy, and the right to life.

### Description

You wake up in a hospital to find that your circulatory system has been connected to an unconscious famous violinist. You learn that the violinist has a fatal kidney ailment, and you alone have the right blood type to help. The Society of Music Lovers has kidnapped you to enable his survival. If you disconnect, the violinist will die; if you stay connected for nine months, he will fully recover. The question arises: are you morally obliged to stay connected?

### Discussion Guide

Consider the following questions:

1. Should the right to personal autonomy always supersede another's right to life? Are there scenarios where this might not be the case?
2. If you knowingly partake in an action that could result in another being's dependence on you, are you morally obliged to support them??
3. Does consent to a risk equate to responsibility for the outcome?
4. How would you weigh the inconvenience or harm of pregnancy against the potential life of a fetus?
5. Does the temporary nature of pregnancy diminish the woman's right to autonomy?
6. Do you find the analogy between a woman connected to a violinist and a pregnant woman connected to a fetus accurate and useful? If not, can you suggest a different analogy that might be more fitting?
7. How would your perspective change if the duration the violinist needs you was a year, ten years, or a lifetime? Or if the violinist were a child instead of an adult?
8. Beyond the issue of abortion, can you think of other real-life situations where the moral and ethical dilemmas of Thompson's Violinist might apply?

### Key arguments and considerations

Thompson's Violinist thought experiment brings several important aspects into consideration. Here, we will delve deeper into the main arguments and counterarguments surrounding this thought experiment.

**1. Autonomy vs. Right to Life**

Thompson's Violinist is centred around the clash between autonomy and the right to life. It posits that personal autonomy, i.e., the right of individuals to control their own bodies, may override another being's right to life. This perspective holds that being kidnapped and forced to support the violinist (analogous to a fetus) is an unacceptable violation of personal rights, even if it means saving a life.

However, many argue that the right to life should supersede personal autonomy. From this perspective, the life of the violinist (or a fetus) is so fundamentally important that it should be preserved, even at significant inconvenience or discomfort to the individual.

**2. Consent and Responsibility**

Critics of the thought experiment often argue that the analogy falls short when considering the aspect of consent. Most pregnancies occur as a result of consensual sex, where the participants are generally aware of the risk of conception. In this context, they argue, the responsibility is assumed. Unlike the random and unexpected connection to the violinist, there's an element of choice that precedes pregnancy, and therefore, it entails certain moral obligations.

Thomson counters this by introducing another scenario where you unintentionally open a window, and a burglar (the violinist) sneaks in. While you facilitated the scenario unknowingly, she asks whether this makes you responsible for the burglar's well-being.

**3. Relative Weights**

Thomson's Violinist also forces us to consider the balance of the temporary inconvenience or harm of pregnancy against the permanence of death for the fetus. This aspect of the thought experiment has provoked considerable debate.

Critics argue that equating nine months of pregnancy with the lifetime of a potential person oversimplifies the issue and diminishes the value of potential life. On the other hand, proponents underline the physical and psychological impacts of pregnancy and childbirth on a woman. They argue that these impacts extend far beyond 'inconvenience' and can have significant, lifelong effects.

**4. Analogical Disparity**

Another critique is that the analogy between a violinist (an adult with consciousness and experiences) and a fetus (that hasn't developed consciousness or personal experiences) isn't fully equivalent. Some argue that the moral value ascribed to the two cannot be the same, influencing the moral implications of the thought experiment.

These multifaceted arguments and considerations bring to light the complexity of the ethical issues at play, demonstrating why the Thompson's Violinist thought experiment has been widely discussed in philosophical and ethical circles.

### Applications in everyday life

Thompson's Violinist, though a philosophical thought experiment, has significant implications for a variety of real-life issues. It forces us to grapple with complex questions about autonomy, rights, consent, and responsibility that arise in many aspects of society beyond its original application in the abortion debate.

1. **Medical Ethics**: This thought experiment raises important questions in medical ethics about consent, personal autonomy, and the limits of medical intervention. For instance, should a parent be obligated to donate an organ or blood to their child, even if they do not want to? If someone has a unique capability to save a life, does society have a right to compel them to do so?
2. **Legal and Societal Responsibilities**: The analogy also provides insight into discussions about legal and societal obligations. To what extent are we obligated to help others, and when does this encroach upon personal freedom? For instance, consider the laws around mandatory vaccination in a public health crisis.
3. **Environmental Ethics**: From an environmental perspective, we can view the Earth as the life-supporting 'body' to which we are all connected. This raises questions about our responsibilities to the planet and the potential consequences of our actions. If our actions risk causing harm to the Earth (analogous to the violinist), do we have a moral responsibility to change our behaviors?
4. **Gender and Social Justice**: The thought experiment also has implications for discussions on gender equality and social justice. It highlights the importance of personal autonomy and consent, which are key issues in debates about reproductive rights, sexual consent, and the societal expectations placed on different genders.

Thompson's Violinist, therefore, is more than an abstract ethical scenario. It prompts reflection on numerous practical, ethical dilemmas we face in our lives and societies, making it a valuable tool for exploring and understanding these complex issues.
