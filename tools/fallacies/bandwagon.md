# Bandwagon

### What is Bandwagon Fallacy?

A bandwagon fallacy, or otherwise known as "appeal to popularity," involves an individual assuming something is true or right because many people believe it.

### Example

"Most Malaysians on social media agree that he is a sexist, so it must be true."

This is a case of bandwagon fallacy because it assumes the truth of the accusation is proven by the _number_ of people agreeing, not by actual evidence.
