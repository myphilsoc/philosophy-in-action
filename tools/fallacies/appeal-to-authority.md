# Appeal to Authority

### What is Appeal to Authority?

Appeal to authority involves arguing that a claim must be true _just because_ an authority figure or expert supports it, instead of providing actual reasoning or evidence.

### Example

We should accept this policy because a former Prime Minister supported it, and he obviously knows best about the country.

The argument relies only on the authority’s status (“he obviously knows best”) instead of examining the merits or flaws of the policy itself.
