# Hasty Generalisation

### What is Hasty Generalisation?

Hasty generalisation involves drawing a broad conclusion from a small or unrepresentative sample. It usually happens in an inductive argument. An inductive argument is a type of reasoning where we draw a general conclusion based on specific observations or evidence. It makes generalised conclusion from specific examples.

### Example

"If you are Chinese, then you must be against the abolishment of vernacular schools."

This is hasty generalisation because the person draws a sweeping conclusion about a whole group based on limited evidence, stereotypes, or assumptions.

Note that this is _also_ an instance of Ad Hominem argument because the person is making assumption or discrediting a viewpoint _based on the speakerâ€™s identity_ (in this case, their ethnicity) rather than addressing the substance of the argument itself.&#x20;
