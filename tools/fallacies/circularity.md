# Circularity

### What is circularity?

Circularity, also known as circular reasoning or begging the question, is a logical fallacy that occurs when an argument relies on its own conclusion as one of its premises. In other words, it happens when the reasoning used to support a claim merely restates the claim instead of providing independent evidence or arguments.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Circularity is considered a flawed form of reasoning because it doesn't offer any new information or justification for the claim being made.
{% endhint %}

For example, a circular argument might be: "This medicine is effective because it works." The claim that the medicine is effective is supported by the premise that it works, which is just a restatement of the claim. A better argument would provide independent evidence, such as clinical trial results or expert testimonials, to support the claim that the medicine is effective.

### How circularity affects us in everyday life&#x20;

Here's are some ways circularity affects us in everyday life:

<details>

<summary>Communication</summary>

Circular reasoning can lead to unproductive discussions or debates, as it doesn't provide any new information or evidence to support a claim. This can make it difficult to reach a consensus or find common ground on contentious issues.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Decision-making</summary>

Relying on circular arguments can result in poor decision-making, as it may lead us to accept claims without sufficient evidence or justification. This can result in biased or ill-informed choices.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Critical thinking</summary>

Encountering circular reasoning in our own thoughts or the arguments of others can help us develop our critical thinking skills by forcing us to recognise and question the underlying assumptions and logic of our beliefs.

### Key considerations and takeaways

To deal with circularity effectively in everyday life, it's important to:

* Be aware of the potential for circular reasoning in our own thoughts and arguments, as well as those of others.
* Develop the ability to identify and challenge circular arguments by looking for independent evidence or reasons to support a claim.
* Foster open-mindedness and a willingness to consider alternative perspectives or explanations, even if they contradict our initial beliefs or assumptions.

When an argument relies on its own conclusion as one of its premises, this results in flawed reasoning which can negatively impact communication, decision-making, and critical thinking in everyday life. By being aware of the potential for circularity and developing the ability to identify and challenge circular arguments, we can improve our reasoning skills and make better-informed decisions.
