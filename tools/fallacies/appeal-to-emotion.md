# Appeal to Emotion

### What is Appeal to Emotion?

Someone who appeals to emotion convince others by manipulating their emotions instead of presenting logical reasons.

### Example

"It is cruel to see your parents suffer, so we have the duty to take care of our parents when they are old."

The argument highlights the _cruelty_ and emotional pain of watching parents suffer, aiming to evoke pity, guilt, or compassion. The conclusion (that we have a duty to care for parents) may be valid, but here it is supported by an emotional reaction, not by logical reasons (like reciprocity, moral obligation, cultural values, or ethical principles).
