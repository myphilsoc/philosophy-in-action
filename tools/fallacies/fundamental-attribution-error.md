# Fundamental attribution error

### What is fundamental attribution error?

The fundamental attribution error (FAE) is a concept in social psychology that describes our tendency to overemphasize personal characteristics and ignore situational factors in judging others' behavior.&#x20;

In simple terms, it's our inclination to attribute people's actions more to their personality or disposition and less to their circumstances or environment.

### Example

Let's say you're driving and someone cuts you off. Your immediate reaction might be to label the driver as reckless or inconsiderate. This is the FAE in action â€” you're attributing the person's behavior to their inherent traits, overlooking possible situational factors like they might be rushing to the hospital or dealing with an emergency.
