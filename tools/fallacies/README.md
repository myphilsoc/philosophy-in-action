# ðŸ’« Fallacies

### What are Logical Fallacies?

Logical fallacies are errors in reasoning that weaken an argument. They tend to seem persuasive at first but break down under closer examination because they rely on flawed logic, or emotional manipulation rather than sound reasoning.

### Consequences of Committing Logical Fallacies?

1. **Erosion of Credibility**

Credibility is the currency of trust between people. When one relies on fallaciesâ€”whether knowingly or out of negligenceâ€”one risks diminishing the trust between people. They also bend communities toward division, confusion, and sometimes even tyranny.&#x20;

2. **Spread of Misinformation**

By committing logical fallacies, one amplifies false or misleading ideas or arguments in ways that make them appear reasonable, even when they are not. Instead of guiding others toward truth, fallacies cloak weak arguments in persuasive rhetoric and misinformation.

3. **Erosion of Critical Thinking**

Not recognising or being ignorant of fallacious argument halts critical thinking. It prevents the mind from wrestling with our judgements or assumptions, and expanding our minds with diverse perspectivecs.

4. **Bad Decisions and Broken Relationships**

Logical fallacies can result in bad decisions and broken relationships because they replace honest reasoning with shortcuts that seem persuasive but ignore the real issues at hand. For example, when someone falls for a _false dilemma_, they may believe there are only two choices and overlook better alternatives, leading to poor decisions in personal, financial, or professional life. Similarly, when arguments slip into _ad hominem_ attacks, the focus shifts from solving problems to attacking each other, which creates resentment and erodes trust.&#x20;

5. **Real-World Harm**

Misinformation built on fallacies influences behavior: people may refuse medical care, vote against their own interests, or adopt harmful stereotypes.
