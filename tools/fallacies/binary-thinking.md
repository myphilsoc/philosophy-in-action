# Binary Thinking

### What is Binary Thinking?

Binary thinking, or sometimes known as "black-and-white thinking," is about presenting or seeing only two options when more exist.

### Example

Donald Trump repeatedly cast Hillary Clinton as the epitome of corruption and dysfunction: calling her “crooked,” a “world-class liar,” and “the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency." By contrast, he positioned himself as the straight-talking, anti-establishment candidate who would “drain the swamp” and reclaim power for everyday Americans.

This involves a _false dichotomy_ that oversimplifies a debate by presenting only two opposing options, while disregarding other possibilities or nuances.
