# Slippery Slope

### What is Slippery Slope?

A slippery slope happens when someone claims that allowing one small action will inevitably lead to extreme and undesirable consequences, without providing solid evidence for the chain of events.

### Example

If we allow students to wear non-uniform hairstyles in schools, soon they will reject all discipline, and our school will turn into a gangster community!

It’s slippery slope because it exaggerates the possible consequences of a minor policy change and treats them as unavoidable. There’s no logical proof that permitting varied hairstyles will directly cause total collapse of discipline or lead to gangs!
