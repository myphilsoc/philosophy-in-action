# Appeal to Tradition

### What is Appeal to Tradition?

Appeal to tradition involves claiming something is correct just because it has always been done that way, in other words, by appealing to tradition.

### Example

"It’s been our tradition to marry within our own race, so whoever doesn’t follow it is wrong and disrespectful."

This is an appeal to tradition because it argues that a practice must be right or good _just because it has always been done that way_. The reasoning doesn’t consider whether the tradition is fair, ethical, or suitable in the present — it assumes tradition itself is the only justification.
