# Ad Hominem

### What is Ad Hominem argument?

Ad hominem argument attacks the person instead of addressing their argument.

### Example

"You are a Malay. Of course you'd think that the Chinese are not patriotic."&#x20;

This is an ad hominem point because the person dismisses the viewpoint by pointing to the speakerâ€™s ethnic identity, rather than examining whether the argument about patriotism is logically or factually valid. The assumption is that _because of who the person is_, their opinion must be biased and therefore invalid.
