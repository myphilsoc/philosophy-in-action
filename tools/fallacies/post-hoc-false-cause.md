# Post Hoc (False Cause)

### What is False Cause?

False cause fallacy assumes that because one thing happened after another, it caused it.

### Example

"Since the government changed, food prices went up. The new government must have caused inflation."

Itâ€™s false cause because it confuses correlation (events happening together) with causation (one event directly causing the other).
