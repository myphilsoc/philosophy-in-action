### What are conditionals?

Conditionals are statements that express a relationship between two events or situations, where one event or situation depends on the other. They often take the form "if A, then B," which means that if A happens, B will happen as well. Conditionals help us understand cause-and-effect relationships and make predictions about the outcomes of our actions or choices.

### How to apply conditionals in everyday life
