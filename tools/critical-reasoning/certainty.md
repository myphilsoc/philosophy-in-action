# Certainty

### What is certainty?

Certainty is the feeling or state of being completely sure or confident about something, without any doubts or reservations. It represents a high level of conviction or belief in the truth of a particular idea, fact, or outcome.

### Key considerations and takeaways

{% hint style="warning" %}
Certainty can also have negative consequences, particularly if it leads to overconfidence or closed-mindedness. Being excessively certain about our beliefs or opinions can prevent us from considering alternative viewpoints, questioning our assumptions, or adapting to new information. (See [_confirmation bias_](../fallacies/confirmation-bias.md)_)_
{% endhint %}

To discern certainty effectively in everyday life, it's important to:

* Recognize the difference between reasonable certainty, based on evidence and logical reasoning, and blind certainty, which ignores evidence or alternative perspectives.
* Be open to questioning our certainty when new information or viewpoints emerge, maintaining a willingness to revise our beliefs or opinions as needed.
* Balance certainty with humility and open-mindedness, acknowledging that our knowledge and understanding may be limited or imperfect.

Certainty plays a significant role in our everyday lives, affecting our decision-making, confidence, communication, and relationships. While certainty can be a useful and empowering feeling, it's important to approach it with a balance of humility and open-mindedness to ensure that we remain receptive to new information and ideas.\
