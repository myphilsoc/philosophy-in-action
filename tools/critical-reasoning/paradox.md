# Paradox

### What is a paradox?

A paradox is a statement, situation, or concept that seems self-contradictory or illogical at first glance but often reveals a deeper truth or insight upon closer examination. Paradoxes challenge conventional reasoning and provoke thought by presenting conflicting elements that coexist.

This is not to be confused with contradictions (see Contradiction) which refers to logical inconsistencies that do not reveal deeper truths.&#x20;

### Embracing paradoxes as a reasoning tool

In Western philosophy, paradoxes have often been treated as problems to be resolved or dismissed as logical inconsistencies. This stems from a commitment to principles like the Law of Non-Contradiction, which asserts that contradictory statements cannot both be true simultaneously.

In East Asian traditions like Daoism and Buddhism, paradoxes are central to understanding the nature of reality. For instance, Daoist texts such as the Daodejing describe the Dao (the Way) as something that cannot be fully articulated: “The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.” While this appears paradoxical, it reflects the ineffable and dynamic nature of existence.

Such paradoxes highlight the limitations of Eurocentric logic while affirming the validity and richness of indigenous worldviews. By valuing paradoxes, these traditions offer alternative pathways for understanding complexity, fostering creativity, and addressing global challenges in ways that transcend binary thinking.&#x20;

### How can we apply paradoxes in everyday life?

Here's are some ways we can apply paradoxes in everyday life:

<summary>Decision-making</summary>

Paradoxes often arise in decisions requiring balance between conflicting priorities, such as short-term success versus long-term growth or control versus empowerment. Recognizing these tensions allows for nuanced decision-making that integrates both sides.

For example, the “[paradox of choice](https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_the_paradox_of_choice)” teaches us that having too many options can lead to decision paralysis. Simplifying choices or adopting a [“good is good enough” mindset](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/the-liberating-effect-of-good-enough-for-now/) can reduce stress and improve satisfaction.&#x20;

<summary>Creative problem-solving</summary>

Embracing paradoxes helps break free from linear thinking and encourages “both/and” approaches instead of “either/or” choices. For example, the tension between efficiency and innovation can inspire creative solutions that balance streamlined processes with groundbreaking ideas.

There is a group-based inquiry practice called [Wicked Questions from Liberating Structures](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/4-wicked-questions/) that "expose safely the tension between espoused strategies and on-the-ground circumstances and to discover the valuable strategies that lie deeply hidden in paradoxical waters.

<summary>Cultivating wisdom</summary>

Paradoxes challenge rigid beliefs and encourage open-mindedness by showing that opposites can coexist. For example, understanding that “[the more you learn, the more you realize how much you don’t know](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/620163-the-more-i-learn-the-more-i-realize-how-much)” fosters humility and lifelong learning.

<summary>Liberation through decolonisation</summary>

Paradoxes play a role in decolonization by disrupting colonial frameworks that imposed rigid binaries (e.g., civilized/uncivilized). They allow for the reclamation of indigenous knowledge systems that accommodate fluidity and coexistence.

<summary>Navigating complexity</summary>

Paradoxes teach us to embrace the inherent contradictions of life, such as the need to take care of ourselves in order to care for others or the idea that [change is the only constant](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heraclitus/#Flu).

### Key considerations and takeaways

These are some ways we can learn from paradoxes effectively:

* Embrace complexity rather than seeking immediate resolution
* Avoid binary thinking (e.g. yes/no, either/or, etc.)
* Be willing to explore perspectives that may seem counterintuitive or contradictory at first.
* Paradoxes often depend on context for their meaning and relevance. Consider the cultural, philosophical, or situational background in which a paradox arises. For example, Zen Buddhism view paradoxes as tools for transcending dualistic thought, while Western traditions may frame them as logical puzzles.
* Not all truths fit neatly into logical frameworks. Paradoxes often point to insights that transcend rational analysis, such as truths that can only be realised through direct experience.
* Paradoxes often lack clear answers or resolutions. Learning to sit with [ambiguity](ambiguity.md) can foster resilience and adaptability in uncertain situations.
