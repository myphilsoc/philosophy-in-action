# Thought Experiment

### What is a thought experiment?

A thought experiment is a mental exercise that involves imagining hypothetical situations or scenarios to help us explore ideas, concepts, or problems more deeply. It's like creating a story or situation in our minds to help us think through different possibilities and understand the implications of various choices or principles.

To apply reduction effectively in everyday life, it's important to::

* Be imaginative and open-minded when creating hypothetical situations, considering a wide range of possibilities and perspectives.
* Analyse the outcomes and consequences of different choices or principles within the context of the thought experiment, looking for insights that can be applied to real-life situations.
* Be adaptable when applying insights derived from thought experiments. Do not get overly fixated on the exact specifics or details of the hypothetical situation. The key here is finding useful insights, not perfection.
