### What is definition?

A definition is a clear and concise explanation of the meaning of a word, term, or concept. Definitions help us understand and communicate ideas by providing a common reference point for what a particular word or phrase represents.

### How definitions are used in everyday life

### Key considerations when using definitions

To use definitions effectively in everyday life, it's important to:

* Be precise and clear when defining words or terms, ensuring that the definition accurately reflects the intended meaning.

* Be open to revising or refining definitions as new information or perspectives emerge, recognizing that our understanding of words or concepts may evolve over time.

Definitions play a crucial role in our everyday lives, facilitating communication, learning, problem-solving, and critical thinking. By providing a common reference point for understanding words, terms, and concepts, definitions help us navigate the world around us and make sense of new ideas and experiences.
