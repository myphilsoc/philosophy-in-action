# Contradiction

### What is a contradiction?

A contradiction occurs when two or more statements, ideas, or conditions directly oppose each other, making them logically incompatible. Contradictions cannot be true simultaneously under the same conditions. For example:

* “I have no pets, but I’ve always had a dog.”
* A square circle.

In logic, contradictions violate the principle of non-contradiction, which states that something cannot be both true and not true at the same time in the same sense.

### How can we make sense of contradictions in everyday life?

Here's are some ways we can navigate contradictions everyday life:

Contradictions often arise because we are complex beings with multifaceted desires, emotions, and beliefs. Instead of trying to resolve or eliminate them, we can embrace them as part of our humanity.

For example, someone might value environmental conservation but drive a petrol SUV. This contradiction can create cognitive dissonance, but instead of denying it, the person might acknowledge the tension and take small steps toward alignment, like reducing unnecessary trips or investing in carbon offsets.

We can take a step further by asking questions like:

* Why do I feel this way?&#x20;
* What does this tension reveal about my values or priorities?
* What can I do in response to resolving these tensions (if there is a need to resolve them)?

Contradictions push us to question assumptions and expand our perspectives. They challenge us to think critically and adapt.&#x20;

For example, someone tasked with improving quality while cutting costs might initially see these goals as incompatible. However, by embracing the contradiction, they could explore innovative solutions like streamlining processes or investing in technology that achieves both goals simultaneously.

There is a group-based inquiry practice called [Wicked Questions from Liberating Structures](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/4-wicked-questions/) that "expose safely the tension between espoused strategies and on-the-ground circumstances and to discover the valuable strategies that lie deeply hidden in paradoxical waters.

### Key considerations and takeaways

These are some ways we can learn from contradictions effectively:

* Contradictions are a normal part of life, reflecting the complexity of human experiences, beliefs, and emotions. Instead of resisting or dismissing them, accept that they often coexist in dynamic tension. For example, feeling both excitement and fear about a new opportunity is natural; both emotions can coexist without invalidating each other.
* Determine whether the contradiction arises from internal conflicts (e.g., personal values or desires) or external factors (e.g., societal expectations or situational demands). Employ distinctions like the [tetralemma](../conceptual-distinctions/tetralemma-catu-ko-i.md) to make sense of them.
* Contradictions often appear irreconcilable because of binary thinking (e.g., “either this or that”). Be willing to explore perspectives that may seem counterintuitive or contradictory at first andlook for ways to integrate or balance opposing elements.
* Contradictions often highlight competing values or priorities. Reflect on what matters most in the specific context to guide your response.
* Consider the broader context in which the contradiction exists. Some contradictions may only appear conflicting because of specific circumstances or perspectives.
* Not all contradictions need immediate resolution. Sometimes, sitting with [ambiguity](ambiguity.md) allows for deeper insight and more creative solutions.
