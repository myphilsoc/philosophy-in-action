# Welcome!

## Hello Thinker.

Hello Thinker, welcome to Philosophy in Action It is an evolving piece of work that informs why we do what we do. To make philosophy practical. At least that’s what we do at the Malaysian Philosophy Society (MyPhilSoc).

In this wiki, you’ll find not only the framework itself, but also a list of tried-and-tested practices we’ve gathered over the years of exploring philosophy. We found them helpful and so we think putting them into a public wiki is the best way to make them accessible to all.

We will continue to update and develop this wiki regularly so do check this space often.

If you’re interested in the people behind the creation of this wiki, do check out who we are.

If you’re interested in contributing to this wiki, do let us know. All are welcome.
