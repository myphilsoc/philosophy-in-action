# üëã Start here

## Hello Thinker.

Welcome to The Everyday Philosopher's Guide!

This isn't just a handbook, it's an invitation to embark on a journey to explore the different ways we can build a life worth living through philosophical ideas and methods.

Just like philosophy itself, this handbook isn't set in stone. It's more like a garden that we're tending together, growing and changing with every new idea and discovery. As the gardeners of this space, we're always planting new seeds as we come across fresh and exciting developments in the world of philosophy.

## Finding Your Way Around

If you're looking for something specific, use the search function at the top right corner of your screen. And if you have a specific question, switch the toggle to Lens and type your question. It's pretty solid. üòâ
{% endhint %}

The Everyday Philosopher's Guide contains all you need to start weaving philosophy into your life. We've packed it with all the tried-and-true tools and practices we've picked up on our own philosophical journeys. We've found them super helpful, and we think you might too, so we're sharing them here for everyone to use.

**Empty Entries Ahead!**

You might notice that some of our entries are currently empty. We want to assure you that there are good reasons for this, and we're working diligently to fill in the gaps. Here's why:

üöö **Content Migration**\
We're still in the process of transferring some of the existing content to the wiki. Rest assured, we're working hard to make sure all the valuable information finds its way here soon.

üßë‚Äçüè´ **Expertise Needed**\
In some cases, we haven't yet delved into certain topics simply because we don't have the necessary expertise. We recognise the importance of these subjects and are actively seeking collaboration with experts to build comprehensive, accurate entries. **If you're knowledgeable in any of these areas, or know someone who is, we'd love to hear from you!** Reach out to us at **hello@myphilsoc.com**

Your input and expertise can make a world of difference in expanding our philosophical garden. Please don't hesitate to reach out and help us enrich the Everyday Philosopher's Guide for everyone.

We've split the contents of this guide into three main sections:

### üå± **Shoots**&#x20;

These are the basic building blocks of philosophy, including mental models that come in handy when we're trying to figure things out. There are currently four collections in this section:
