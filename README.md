# üëã Start here

## Hello Thinker.

Welcome to The Everyday Philosopher's Guide!

This isn't just a handbook, it's an invitation to embark on a journey to explore the different ways we can build a life worth living through philosophical ideas and methods.

Just like philosophy itself, this handbook isn't set in stone. It's more like a garden that we're tending together, growing and changing with every new idea and discovery. As the gardeners of this space, we're always planting new seeds as we come across fresh and exciting developments in the world of philosophy.

## Finding Your Way Around

The Everyday Philosopher's Guide contains all you need to get started to start weaving philosophy into your life. We've packed it with all the tried-and-true tools and practices we've picked up on our own philosophical journeys. We've found them super helpful, and we think you might too, so we're sharing them here for everyone to use.

We've split the contents of this guide into three main sections:

üå± **Shoots** \
These are the basic building blocks of philosophy, including mental models that come in handy when we're trying to figure things out.

‚öìÔ∏è **Roots**\
Every idea has to come from somewhere. Drawing from diverse traditions around the world, we explore the different philosophical traditions and examine how they've shaped the way we think today.

üçé **Fruits** \
Here, we look at the real-world benefits of philosophy. We'll show you how philosophical ideas and methods can make a difference in everything from your personal self-reflection to big societal issues like public policy, healthcare, and education.
