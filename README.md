# üëã Start Here - What is the Everyday Philosopher's Guide?

## Hello Thinker.

Welcome to The Everyday Philosopher's Guide!

If you're seeking to learn how to apply philosophical tools and live more reflective, examined lives, you've come to the right place!

This guide contains all you need to start building a life worth living through philosophical ideas and methods. We've found them super helpful, and we think you might too, so we're sharing them here for everyone to use.&#x20;

For free.

Just like philosophy itself, this handbook isn't set in stone. It's more like a garden that we're tending together, growing and changing with every new idea and discovery. As the gardeners of this space, we're always planting new seeds as we come across fresh and exciting developments in applied and practical philosophy.
