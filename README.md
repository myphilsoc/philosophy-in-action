## Hello Thinker.

Welcome to Philosophy in Action!

This is an open-source guide on doing philosophy. By doing philosophy, we mean incorporating philosophical ideas and methods into our lives.

Like all wikis, this will continue to be an evolving piece of work and never be finished. As stewards and contributors of this space, we will add new sections to this guide overtime as we come across new developments in the field of philosophical practice.

## An Overview of Structure

We explore philosophical practice through asking fundamental questions, namely exploring what, why and how. In this wiki, you’ll find not only the framework itself, but also a list of tried-and-tested practices we’ve gathered over the years of exploring philosophy. We found them helpful and so we think putting them into a public wiki is the best way to make them accessible to all.

If you’re interested in the people behind the creation of this wiki, do check out [who we are](who/our-contributors/).

We're also looking for contributors, critics and translators so if you’re interested, do let us know at malaysianphilsoc@gmail.com

All are welcome.
