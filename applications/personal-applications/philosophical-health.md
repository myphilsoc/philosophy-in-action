# Philosophical Health

### What is philosophical health?

The concept of philosophical health is relatively new. Having said that, a working definition of what philosophical health has been formulated.

Philosophical health refers to the state of fruitful coherence between a person's ways of thinking and speaking and their ways of acting, such that the possibilities for a fulfilling life are increased and the [need for self and intersubjective flourishing is satisfied](https://blogs.bmj.com/medical-humanities/2021/04/15/beyond-physical-and-psychological-health-philosophical-health/).&#x20;

### How is philosophical health different from physical and mental health?

Traditional views of health often focus on the physical, sometimes including the mental. However, the intersection with philosophy introduces a broader spectrum, considering existential and ethical dimensions of living. Philosophical health implies that well-being is not just the absence of illness but involves the pursuit of a meaningful, virtuous, and reflective life.

In this sense, philosophical health tends to approach the concept of health as a whole rather than focusing on certain aspects of the self.&#x20;

### How can we improve our philosophical health?

In [Five Principles of Philosophical Health](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353333904\_Five\_Principles\_of\_Philosophical\_Health\_for\_Critical\_Times\_From\_Hadot\_to\_Crealectics), Luis de Miranda offers ways we can work on our philosophical health through drawing the works of Pierre Hadot.

<summary>Cultivate mental heroism</summary>

This principle emphasizes the need for courage and heroism in one's mental life. It's about maintaining an elevated view and well-being in everyday events, especially during crises. It involves the ability to live in dual planes: being actively engaged in daily life while maintaining inner peace and freedom.&#x20;

This principle suggests that individuals can strive to achieve a balance between engaging with the world and nurturing their inner selves. Collectively, it advocates for a society where people are not only resilient but also maintain a higher moral and ethical awareness.

<summary>Having a deep orientation in life</summary>

This means having an inner compass that guides your actions and enables you to live life meaningfully and authentically.

This orientation is not dogmatic but is rooted in a profound existential and spiritual understanding. On a personal level, it implies living life with purpose and on a collective level, it encourages societies to move towards more meaningful collective goals, rather than being driven by transient or superficial objectives.

<summary>Engaging with the world through critical creativity</summary>

This involves engaging in creative and innovative activities that challenge our usual ways of thinking and doing could stimulate philosophical growth and a deeper sense of freedom.

In some cases especially in moments that demand critical attention, one would need to  practice making deliberate choices that align with one's values and the greater good. This involves an openness to change while staying true to one's principles, a willingness to question our assumptions, and the agility to adjust our strategies in the pursuit of truth, justice, honesty, and knowledge.

<summary>Cultivating an attitude of attentive, engaged, and reflective listening</summary>

Deep listening is not a passive act. Rather, it's a dynamic, interactive process where both listener and speaker co-create the emergence of meaning and understanding.

Listening also naturally motivates one to comprehend the peculiarities and singularities of objects, ideas, or practices, while also situating them within a broader context. Through deep listening, we are able to foster a deep connection with the world around us.

<summary>Embracing creative possibility</summary>

Miranda introduces the idea of relating to the "Creal", the creative possibility that underpins existence. This entails seeing the world not as a fixed set of circumstances but as a dynamic field of infinite potential, where each moment offers a chance for novel creation and interpretation.

Embracing creative possibility involves engaging in practices that cultivate an awareness and appreciation of the creative flux of being. Possible examples include philosophical study, meditation, creative arts, or simply adopting a mindset that seeks to perceive and appreciate the interconnectedness and potentiality in all aspects of life.
