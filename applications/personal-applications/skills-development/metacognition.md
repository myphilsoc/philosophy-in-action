# Metacognition

### What is metacognition?

Metacognition refers to awareness and understanding of one's own thought processes. It is often described as "thinking about thinking".

There are usually [two aspects](https://tll.mit.edu/teaching-resources/how-people-learn/metacognition/) of metacognition:

<details>

<summary>Metacognitive knowledge</summary>

This includes self-awareness about one's learning processes, the task of learning and how information is processed, and strategies for learning. It encompasses knowledge of oneself as a learner (strengths, weaknesses, preferences) and how the brain encodes, organises and retrieves information.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Metacognitive regulation</summary>

This is the ability to control one's thinking and learning through strategies like planning, monitoring progress, and evaluating outcomes. It involves skills to deliberately monitor and direct one's own learning processes

### The differences between critical thinking and metacognition

Although interrelated, there are key differences between critical thinking and metacognition:

1. Metacognition is more personal and internal, referring to awareness and understanding of one's own thought processes. Critical thinking, while also involving self-reflection, is more outwardly focused on analysing and evaluating information and arguments.
2. Metacognition is a higher-order process that can encompass critical thinking. Critical thinking can be seen as a [component or subset of metacognition](https://typeset.io/questions/is-critical-thinking-a-component-of-metacognition-2ba1qp5lsw).
3. Usually, the goal of metacognition is to understand the effectiveness and efficiency of one's own thinking and learning strategies. On the other hand, the goal of critical thinking is to reach well-reasoned conclusions and solutions.

### Why metacognition is important?

Metacognition is an important skill to overcome challenges in the 21st Century. Here are a few reasons why:

<details>

<summary>Enhances academic performance</summary>

Metacognition is considered critical for successful learning. In education, students with stronger metacognitive skills tend to [learn better and have higher achievement levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8734377/). A [meta-analytic study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11409-018-9183-8) has shown that metacognition is one of the most significant predictors of academic performance.&#x20;

It is also a teachable skill that instructors can help students develop. Studies have shown that the average impact from explicitly teaching metacognition and self-regulation strategies is an [additional seven months’ progress over the course of a year](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/education-evidence/teaching-learning-toolkit/metacognition-and-self-regulation).

<details>

<summary>Supports critical thinking and problem-solving</summary>

Metacognition often involves higher-order thinking skills like analysis, evaluation, and self-reflection needed for complex problem-solving. These skills enable transferring knowledge and strategies across different contexts.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Promotes independent, self-regulated learning</summary>

Metacognitive skills enable students to take control of their own learning process by planning, monitoring, and evaluating their approach. In this sense, metacognition develops learners' ability to recognise their strengths, weaknesses, and effective strategies that work in their respective context and situation.&#x20;

### How philosophy can improve metacognition?

Engaging in philosophical inquiry and learning to think critically can do wonders for understanding and controlling our own thinking processes. This includes being more aware of how we think (metacognitive knowledge) and getting better at managing our thinking strategies, like planning, checking our progress, and evaluating how we did (metacognitive regulation).

Research shows there's a strong link between being good at critical thinking and having high metacognitive abilities. For instance, [a study with 390 university students](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1085910.pdf) found that those who were better critical thinkers also had better metacognitive skills.

Furthermore, Philosophy for Children (P4C) programs have been shown to [increase levels of metacognitive reflection and understanding in students](https://www.sapere.org.uk/why-sapere-p4c/research-evidence/). A [study conducted by the Philosophy Foundation](https://philarchive.org/archive/WORTCT) has also found that teaching critical thinking skills explicitly within the context of philosophical inquiry can further boost metacognitive development compared to philosophical discussion alone

At the heart of philosophical exploration—through its iterative questioning, logical reasoning, and rigorous discussion—lies the potent mechanism for metacognitive enhancement. By encouraging individuals to critically analyze their thought patterns, question underlying assumptions, and engage in reflective dialogue, philosophical inquiry acts as a springboard for advanced metacognitive skills. This not only elevates one's self-awareness but also empowers individuals to regulate their cognitive processes more effectively, paving the way for a richer, more introspective learning experience.
