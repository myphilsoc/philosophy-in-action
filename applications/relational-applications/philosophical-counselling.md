# Philosophical Counselling

### What is philosophical counselling/philosophical coaching?

Philosophical counselling (sometimes called philosophical coaching) is an approach that uses philosophical methods and insights to help individuals explore and address personal, existential, and ethical issues in their lives. Usually, it is a form of consultation provided by philosophers or those trained in philosophical thinking and dialogue.&#x20;

Philosophical counselling cannot substitute conventional treatment for mental health conditions. The goal of philosophical counselling is not psychological therapy or treatment of mental illness, but rather to engage the client in philosophical self-examination and reflection on their beliefs, values, assumptions, and ways of thinking.

### Common Techniques used in Philosophical Counselling

Philosophical counsellors use techniques like clarifying concepts, exposing assumptions, examining worldviews, exploring philosophical perspectives, and applying philosophical insights to the client's specific situation or dilemma.

These techniques often draw from the ancient philosophical tradition of using reason and questioning to gain wisdom and live an examined life, exemplified by Socrates' approach of questioning to expose contradictions and gain self-knowledge.

### Benefits of Philosophical Counselling

Here are some of the benefits of philosophical counselling:

* It can help clients gain clarity on their core beliefs, values, and life's meaning, as well as develop critical thinking and reasoning skills.
* It is applied to issues such as career changes, ethical dilemmas, relationship problems, finding purpose, dealing with mortality, and major life transitions.&#x20;
* While not psychotherapy, it is considered therapeutic in the sense of promoting wisdom, self-understanding, and living a meaningful and examined life.&#x20;
* It provides an alternative or complementary approach to psychological counselling by addressing the philosophical underpinnings of human issues.

### How to be a philosophical counsellor?

{% hint style="danger" %}
There is no statutory regulation or legally protected title for philosophical counsellors or practitioners. Anyone can use the title "philosophical counsellor" without meeting specific training, certification or registration requirements.

Although there are professional associations like the National Philosophical Counseling Association (NPCA) in the U.S. and American Philosophical Practitioners Association (APPA) that provide certification programs, these are not legally mandated.

In the United States, organizations like the [American Philosophical Practitioners Association (APPA)](https://appa.edu) and the [National Philosophical Counseling Association (NPCA)](https://npcassoc.org/) have played pivotal roles in setting the standards for professional practice. These bodies offer [certification programmes](https://appa.edu/programs/) that are designed to credential philosophical counsellors.

However, it's important to recognise that the requirements set forth by these associations may not fully capture one's competence in philosophical counselling. Certification can serve as a foundational step, but it is merely the beginning of a more extensive journey of professional and personal development.

Furthermore, while these courses offered by these associations lay the groundwork, true proficiency in philosophical counselling is cultivated through extensive and continuous practice. Mastery in philosophy, while essential, is not the sole prerequisite for excelling as a philosophical counsellor. Like all forms of counselling, it is still up to the practitioner's ability to engage with clients on a deeply empathetic level. Therefore, skills in active listening, reflective dialogue, and emotional intelligence are essential.&#x20;

Good philosophical counsellors often navigate the complexities of human experience, offering insights not just from a place of intellectual understanding, but also from a stance of compassionate presence. This nuanced blend of philosophy and counselling competency underscores the necessity for a broader skill set beyond academic knowledge.

Such experience can be gained through engaging with a diverse array of clients. This not only allows a counsellor to refine their approach, but also adapt to varying emotional landscapes and integrate philosophical concepts into the counselling process in a way that is both meaningful and impactful. It is through this ongoing practice that a counsellor can transcend the foundational knowledge obtained in certification courses and truly embody the role of a philosophical guide.

The field of philosophical counselling is at a developmental juncture with a small but growing community of practitioners. Despite its nascent status, the discipline is witnessing an increasing interest from people who are seeking alternative modalities of counselling that focus on philosophical inquiry as a means of addressing life's challenges. This growing interest not only enriches the community of practitioners but also contributes to the continuous exploration and expansion of the field's boundaries.

We are aware the field philosophical counselling is active in non-English speaking parts of the world (including parts of Europe). However due to language barriers, we are unable to offer a comprehensive analysis of this aspect of the practice and are actively seeking experts who can advise on this.&#x20;
