# Existential Coaching

### What is existential coaching?

Existential coaching (sometimes called [existential therapy](https://nspc.org.uk/about-the-school/the-existential-approach/)) is an approach to coaching that draws upon the principles and ideas of existential philosophy and psychology. It aims to help clients explore fundamental questions about their existence, find meaning and purpose, and live authentically in the face of life's challenges.

### Existential coaching techniques and tools

Here are some ways existential coaching helps clients explore their sense of self:

<details>

<summary>Examining worldview and values</summary>

The coach invites the client to reflect on their beliefs, values, and assumptions about themselves and the world. This builds self-awareness of how the client makes meaning and what matters most to them.

<summary>Exploring existential dimensions</summary>

The coach and client look at the client's experiences and challenges through the lens of key existential themes - the [physical, social, personal and spiritual dimensions of existence](https://humanefutureofwork.com/existential-coaching-what-is-it/). This holistic exploration illuminates the client's way of being.

<summary>Confronting limitations and anxiety</summary>

Existential coaching encourages clients to face the [inherent limitations and anxieties of the human condition](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/introduction-existential-coaching-yannick-jacob), such as mortality, uncertainty, responsibility and isolation. Reflecting on these builds understanding of one's reactions and choices.

<details>

<summary>Identifying authenticity and inauthenticity</summary>

The coach helps the client recognize where they are living according to their true values and sense of self vs where they are being inauthentic or incongruent. This clarity allows more authentic ways of being.

<details>

<summary>Owning freedom and responsibility</summary>

The coach helps the client by [asking them to reflect on their freedom](https://quenza.com/blog/knowledge-base/existential-therapy-exercises/#commonexistentialtherapyexercises) to make choices and the consequences of their decisions. This allows the client to recognise that they have the freedom and responsibility to make choices about their life and identity.&#x20;

### How do I become an existential coach?

{% hint style="danger" %}
There is no statutory regulation or legally protected title for coaches. Anyone can use the title "existential coach" without meeting specific training, certification or registration requirements.

Although there are professional associations like the [International Coach Federation](https://coachingfederation.org/), they are not legally mandated.

Existential coaching requires the ability to explore deep questions of meaning, authenticity and the human condition with clients.

One way to train this ability is to develop a strong foundation in existential philosophy and psychology. This would probably involve studying the works of key existential thinkers like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Sartre, and Camus to understand the core principles and themes of existentialism.

Getting training in existential coaching is also another possible pathway. Here are some options:

* The [Certificate in Existential Coaching from The Existential Academy](https://www.existentialacademy.com/whats-on/certificate-in-existential-coaching/), a short program comprising 60 hours of training in existential coaching theory and practice
* The [MA in Existential Coaching](https://nspc.org.uk/course-directory/ma-in-existential-coaching/) from the New School of Psychotherapy and Counselling (NSPC) in London, a 2-year program that provides sufficient training hours to apply for professional accreditation.

In addition, consider pursuing professional accreditation through organizations like the International Coach Federation, although there is no specific existential coaching credential.

The key is to ground yourself in existential philosophy, get quality training that combines theory and practice, develop your coaching skills, gain experience, and commit to ongoing learning.&#x20;
