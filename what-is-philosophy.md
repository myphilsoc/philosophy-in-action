# What is Philosophy

According to the Oxford Dictionary of English, philosophy is the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence. In other words, it is the study of everything.

Think of philosophy as a big adventure into the world of ideas. It's all about asking deep, thoughtful questions like: "What's the meaning of life?", "What's the right thing to do?", "What makes something beautiful?", or "What is reality?"

Philosophy is like a toolkit for thinking. It provides us with ways to reason and argue, helping us to challenge our assumptions, clarify our thoughts, and make better decisions. It's not just about ancient texts and complex theories, but also about how we live our lives and understand the world around us.

In The Everyday Philosopher's Guide, we're trying to make these philosophical tools and ideas accessible to everyone. We believe that philosophy isn't just for academics or intellectuals, but for everyone who's curious about life's big questions.

Remember, philosophy isn't about having all the answers. It's about learning to ask the right questions and thinking deeply about the possible answers. So, don't worry if you're new to philosophy. Just bring an open mind and a sense of curiosity, and you'll fit right in!&#x20;
